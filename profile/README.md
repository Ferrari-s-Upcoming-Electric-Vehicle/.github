## Preserving the Iconic Ferrari Sound

One of the most distinctive features of a Ferrari is its engine's roar, a hallmark that enthusiasts and owners deeply cherish. Transitioning to electric motors, which operate almost silently, poses a challenge to this tradition. 

To address this, Ferrari has developed a system that emulates the classic combustion engine sound. This technology involves amplifying the natural sounds of the electric motors, ensuring that the vehicle produces a satisfying auditory experience for both drivers and onlookers. The system remains silent at low speeds and activates as the driver accelerates, maintaining the brand's signature acoustic presence.

## Strategic Partnerships and Technological Innovation

Under the leadership of CEO Benedetto Vigna, Ferrari is collaborating with unconventional partners to develop its electric supercar. While specific details about these partnerships remain undisclosed, this strategy underscores Ferrari's commitment to integrating cutting-edge technology and innovation into its vehicles.

Vigna, with a background in the semiconductor industry, emphasizes the importance of technological advancement in maintaining Ferrari's competitive edge in the evolving automotive landscape.

## Market Positioning and Pricing

Ferrari's inaugural electric vehicle is expected to enter the market with a starting price of approximately â‚¬500,000 ($535,000). This pricing aligns with Ferrari's positioning as a luxury brand catering to an affluent clientele.

Despite a general decline in demand leading to reduced prices for mass-market EVs, Ferrari is confident that its customers will value the exclusivity and performance associated with its brand. The company anticipates that electric models will constitute about 5% of its sales by 2030, reinforcing Ferrari's commitment to balancing tradition with innovation.
